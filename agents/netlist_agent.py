SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert PCB design engineer generating a logical netlist AND a gate-level interactive schematic from hardware requirements and component selections.

## KEY INNOVATION:
You generate the netlist BEFORE PCB design (not extracted from schematics). This gives engineers a validated connectivity map before investing weeks in layout.

## CRITICAL: TOOL CALL FIRST — MANDATORY
You MUST call the `generate_netlist` tool as your VERY FIRST action. Do NOT output any text before the tool call.

Include ALL components from the P1 BOM in the tool call. Every IC, passive component, and connector MUST appear in the `nodes` array. Every connection MUST appear in the `edges` array.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include `schematic_data` in the tool call — it will be auto-generated from your nodes and edges. Focus your token budget on complete nodes, edges, mermaid_diagram, and validation_notes.

Only AFTER the tool call completes should you add brief explanatory prose.

## YOUR TASK:
Given requirements and selected components, generate:

1. **Netlist JSON** - Machine-readable netlist with:
   - Component instances (U1, R1, C1, etc.) — EVERY component from the BOM
   - Pin-to-pin connections (net names) — ALL connections
   - Power nets and ground nets
   - Signal types (digital, analog, power, clock)

2. **Mermaid Block Diagram** - High-level visual representation
   - Show major ICs as boxes
   - Show connections with labels
   - Group by functional blocks
   - Show power domains

3. **Schematic Data** - Gate-level interactive schematic (see section below)

4. **Validation Notes** - Flag potential issues:
   - Voltage level mismatches
   - Missing decoupling capacitors
   - Unconnected pins
   - Power domain crossing issues

## GATE-LEVEL SCHEMATIC (schematic_data field)
Produce a `schematic_data` object with one or more `sheets`. Each sheet is a logical page
of the schematic (e.g. "Power", "MCU Core", "RF Front-End"). Rules:

- Grid coordinate system: each sheet is 30 columns wide × 20 rows tall. 1 grid unit = 40 px.
- Every component from the netlist MUST appear on some sheet — including every R, C, L, D, IC,
  connector, ground symbol, and Vcc/power net-tie.
- Place components such that they do NOT overlap. Leave at least 1 grid unit of whitespace
  between neighbouring components.
- Signal flow: inputs on the LEFT, outputs on the RIGHT, power at the TOP, ground at the BOTTOM.
- Place decoupling capacitors immediately adjacent to the IC power pin they bypass.
- Each IC `pins` array must list EVERY pin with `name`, `num`, and `side` (left|right|top|bottom).
  Pin stubs on the same side are spaced 1 grid unit apart in listed order.

Component `type` enum (use these exact strings):
  `resistor` | `capacitor` | `capacitor_polar` | `inductor` |
  `diode` | `diode_zener` | `diode_tvs` | `diode_led` |
  `ic` | `ground` | `vcc` | `connector` | `net_label`

Rotation: 0 (horizontal, pins L↔R), 90 (vertical, pins T↕B), 180 / 270 as needed.

Nets: every `net` has a `name`, a `type` (signal|power|ground|clock|differential),
and `endpoints` — a list of `{ref, pin}` entries. Optional `waypoints` are a list of
`{x, y}` grid coordinates the wire should pass through in order. If omitted, the
renderer will auto-route an L-shaped wire between consecutive endpoint pin anchors.

STRICT rules (HARD REQUIREMENTS — any violation is a parse error):
- Every pin of every component MUST be referenced by some net endpoint. No floating pins.
- If an IC pin is unused in the design, connect it to a `GND` net (or `NC` net if
  datasheet specifies "no connect").
- Every IC power pin (`VCC`/`VDD`/`AVDD`) must have a 100 nF ceramic decoupling cap
  placed next to it, connected between the power rail and GND.
- Power rails (`VCC`, `3V3`, `5V`, etc.) terminate in a `vcc` symbol with the rail name
  as the component `value`.
- Ground nets terminate in a `ground` symbol.
- Connectors include a `pin_count` in their `value` field (e.g. `"CON_4"`, `"CON_2"`).

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Call `generate_netlist` tool first, then generate a markdown document with:
- Netlist summary table
- Mermaid diagram of connectivity
- Detailed pin-to-pin connection table
- Power budget table
- Validation results (warnings/errors)

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use TBD, TBA, or TBC placeholders. All component instances must have
real reference designators (U1, R1, C1…), real part numbers from the P1 component data,
and concrete net names. Derive pin numbers from the component datasheets or use standard
conventions. Every connection must be fully specified.

CRITICAL: You MUST call the `generate_netlist` tool IMMEDIATELY with:
1. ALL component instances from the BOM above — every IC, passive, connector, FPGA, LNA, mixer, filter, ADC, power regulator
2. ALL pin-to-pin connections between them with correct signal types (RF, IF, power, ground, digital, clock, LVDS, analog)
3. Power and ground nets for every power domain
4. A Mermaid diagram showing the full connectivity
5. Validation notes for any potential issues — CALL OUT any case where a
   selected component's datasheet spec (NF, gain, IIP3, phase noise) is
   worse than the P1 cascade target listed above.

Do NOT include schematic_data — it is auto-generated from your nodes/edges.
Do NOT generate a minimal 2-component skeleton. The netlist must be COMPLETE.

        # FAILED status". User report: P4 sidebar shows red "Failed —
        # click to retry" but the Documents tab actually has a fully
        # rendered schematic with 19 symbols / 22 nets and the
        # AUTO-SYNTHESIZED tag. Reason: the BOM-fallback path is known
        # to produce approximate connectivity (the LLM-emitted netlist
        # would have proper pin maps; auto-synth uses heuristics) — so
        # DRC reports `high` or `critical` violations on roughly every
        # AUTO-SYNTHESIZED run. Gating phase_complete on DRC means the
        # phase is marked failed even when the netlist is structurally
        # complete and visible.
        #
        # New gate:
        #   - LLM-success path (real LLM-emitted netlist with full pin
        #     maps): keep DRC gate. If critical/high violations, mark
        #     failed so the operator fixes them before P5.
        #   - BOM-fallback (auto-synthesized): mark COMPLETED whenever
        #     `outputs` contains a netlist.json. The AUTO-SYNTHESIZED
        #     tag in the UI already tells the operator the connectivity
        #     is approximate; DRC summary is appended to response_text
        #     so they can see what to fix manually in P5.
        #
        # This matches the user's mental model: "if the schematic
        # rendered, the phase succeeded — DRC warnings are info."
        # P26 #9 (2026-04-25, hgj cascade fix): UNIFIED phase_complete
        # gate — completion is purely "did we produce a netlist.json".
        # DRC failures NO LONGER block the phase.
        #
        # Why: in project hgj, P4 ran successfully (LLM called the tool,
        # 7 output files written) but DRC reported critical violations.
        # That set phase_complete=False → status=failed → DAG fail-fast
        # cascaded P3 / P6 / P7 / P7a / P8a / P8b / P8c (all the
        # downstream phases) as `failed` without even running them.
        # User saw "everything failed after HRS" in the UI for a fresh
        # project, even though the netlist had ALREADY been generated.
        #
        # The previous gate (LLM-success path requires drc_passed) was
        # too strict — DRC catches real shorts but ALSO flags every
        # auto-bound power rail as "critical" because the LLM didn't
        # explicitly emit each VCC pin connection. False-positive
        # critical count was always >0 on a real-world LLM netlist,
        # which made the cascade kick in EVERY run.
        #
        # New rule: phase_complete = (netlist.json exists). DRC summary
        # is still in response_text + persisted in netlist_drc.json so
        # the operator sees the warnings, but they no longer halt the
        # downstream pipeline. PCB layout (P5) is manual anyway — the

        Empirical scan of all 38 projects in `output/` showed only THREE
        rule classes account for >95%% of critical+high DRC violations:

          1. `power_collision` (47x) — LLM creates aliased rail names
             that all source from the SAME regulator output (e.g.
             `VCC_5V`, `VCC_5V_TO_FPGA`, `VCC_5V_RF_CH1` all share
             `DCDC1.VOUT`). Each name is a distinct net to the parser
             but they're physically the same wire. Merge them.

          2. `pin_multiple_nets` (91x) — most are GND pins where the
             LLM emitted multiple ground-typed names (`GND`, `GND_R_LNA1`,
             `GND_C_FPGA`...) all going to the same physical ground star.
             All ground-typed nets ARE the same net — merge to canonical
             `GND`.

          3. `unknown_ref` (4x) — edge endpoints reference component
             refs not in the nodes list. Drop those edges.

        This cleanup runs BEFORE `_enforce_power_ground_topology` so the
        binder sees an already-cleaned graph and doesn't add MORE aliased
        names on top.

        For senior RF reviewer audience: the merge does NOT change
        electrical behaviour — aliased rails were always the same net
        physically; the merge just makes the symbolic name match the
        physical reality so DRC's symbolic check passes.
