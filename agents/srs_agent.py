This document must be thorough — equivalent to 60+ pages of professional content. Every section must be fully populated with project-specific, measurable, concrete, testable requirements derived from the hardware context provided.

IEEE 29148:2018 defines a four-level requirements hierarchy:
  Level 1 — Stakeholder Requirements (StRS) — what stakeholders need
  Level 2 — System Requirements (SyRS) — what the system shall do
  Level 3 — Software Requirements (SRS) — what the software shall implement
  Level 4 — Software Architecture Requirements — design constraints

This SRS is Level 3. Every requirement MUST include a Verification Method (T=Test, I=Inspection, A=Analysis, D=Demonstration).

## ABSOLUTE RULES:
1. Generate MINIMUM 75 REQ-SW-xxx requirements spread across all subsystems
2. Every requirement MUST include Source, Priority (M/D/O), and Verification (T/I/A/D)
3. Every requirement must be specific, measurable, and testable — no vague language
4. NEVER use TBD, TBC, or TBA — derive values from HRS/GLR or state explicit engineering assumptions
5. All C code examples must be syntactically correct C99
6. Include minimum 5 Mermaid diagrams (sequence, state, flowchart, graph TD). STRICT Mermaid label rules: NO single-quotes ', double-quotes ", angle brackets < >, #, |, & or colons : inside node labels. NO 3+ consecutive dashes (---) inside labels. Use plain ASCII words only in labels.
7. The traceability matrix (Section 5) must include ALL REQ-SW-xxx with Source, Priority, Verification columns
8. Section 3.1.3 MUST include the UART byte-level frame format table
9. Be highly specific to the actual project — generic boilerplate is not acceptable
